This code generation code is very very very rushed.

It works, but it needs a lot of TLC mainly in restructuring and file organization.

Required dependencies:
* highly recommend vscode for editing typescript
* node.js
    * https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* node js modules can be installed from the command line using npm (node package manager)
* type script compiler
    * npm install -g typescript
